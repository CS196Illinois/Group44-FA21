# PLAN


Sprint 1: Research listed OpenAI Jukebox and Android UI tools. Setup necessary environments for rest of project.

Sprint 2: On the backend, try to build a model that can take an input song and add onto it based on the input, using OpenAI Jukebox. On the frontend, create a basic Android app with server support.

Sprint 3: On the backend, try to expand this model's functionality to a larger subset, like a genre of music, and analyze the output to see if it's up to par. On the frontend, improve upon the app and build the server that the backend will be feeding data through.

Sprint 4: Connecting the frontend and backend is the priority here. If time allows, try to expand the model even more to all genres and environments. Frontend should continue improving UI and user-friendliness on the app to make it look as clean as possible.

- Group decided on using OpenAI Jukebox: A music generator that makes new music base on the style of another song/ add on to a already made song and prolong it.
  The idea is to use Jukebox to extend recordings of ambient sounds
- Searched about OpenAI Jukebox and how to use it. 
- First tried to install Jukebox on Google Colab but got the failed to initialize NCCL error
- Changed to installing on Mac computer. Was able to get through installing everything except for the Cudatoolkit 10.0 and also ran into the same NCCL error.
  - Ask PM for help and found out that they discontinued support for Mac laptops.
